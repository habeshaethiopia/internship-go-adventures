## Implementing Authentication and Authorization with JWT for Task Management API

### Objective
Enhance the Task Management API by adding authentication and authorization mechanisms using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This enhancement will introduce user management, login functionality, and protected routes to restrict access based on user roles.

### Requirements
- Implement user management functionality to support creating user accounts with unique usernames and passwords.
- Introduce JWT-based authentication to validate user credentials and generate access tokens upon successful login.
- Secure the API endpoints by implementing middleware to validate JWT tokens for authentication.
- Define user roles (e.g., admin, regular user) and restrict access to certain endpoints based on user roles.
- Implement login functionality to authenticate users and generate JWT tokens for subsequent API requests.
- Ensure that only authenticated users with valid JWT tokens can access protected routes.
- Update the API documentation to include instructions for user registration, login, and usage of protected endpoints.
- Test the API endpoints with and without authentication to verify proper enforcement of access control rules.
- Verify that user credentials are securely stored and transmitted using appropriate encryption and hashing techniques.

### Instructions
1. Implement user management endpoints for user registration and login:
   - `POST /register`: Create a new user account with a unique username and password.
   - `POST /login`: Authenticate users and generate JWT tokens upon successful login.
2. Generate JWT tokens with appropriate claims (e.g., user ID, username, expiration time) using a secure JWT library.
3. Implement middleware to validate JWT tokens for protected routes, ensuring that only authenticated users can access them.
4. Define user roles and restrict access to certain endpoints based on user roles using middleware.
5. Update existing API endpoints to enforce authentication and authorization requirements for protected routes.
6. Test the API endpoints using Postman or similar tools to verify that authentication and authorization are working correctly.
7. Verify that only authenticated users can access protected routes, and unauthorized access attempts are rejected with appropriate error responses.
8. Ensure that user credentials are securely stored using appropriate encryption and hashing techniques to protect against security threats.
9. Document the authentication and authorization process, including instructions for user registration, login, and usage of protected endpoints.
10. Update the API documentation to reflect changes related to authentication and authorization, including any modifications to request and response formats.

- [`models/user.go`](task_manager_auth/models/user.go"): Defines the User struct.
- [`data/task_service.go`](task_manager_auth/data/task_service.go"): Contains business logic and data manipulation functions for tasks.
- [`data/user_service.go`](task_manager_auth/data/user_service.go"): Contains business logic and data manipulation functions for users, including hashing passwords.
- [`middleware/auth_middleware.go`](task_manager_auth/middleware/auth_middleware.go"): Implements middleware to validate JWT tokens for authentication and authorization.
- [`router/router.go`](task_manager_auth/router/router.go"): Sets up the routes and initializes the Gin router and defines the routing configuration for the API.
- [`docs/api_documentation.md`](task_manager_auth/docs/api_documentation.md"): Contains API documentation and other related documentation.
- [`go.mod`](task_manager_auth/go.mod"): Defines the module and its dependencies.

### Evaluation Criteria
- Successful implementation of user management functionality for user registration and login.
- Proper generation and validation of JWT tokens for authentication.
- Correct enforcement of access control rules for protected routes based on user roles.
- Secure storage and transmission of user credentials using encryption and hashing techniques.
- Verification of authentication and authorization functionality through testing of API endpoints.
- Clarity and completeness of documentation for authentication and authorization processes.
- Compliance with the provided instructions and requirements.

### Note
Authentication and authorization are critical components of web applications to ensure secure access to resources. Pay close attention to implementing these mechanisms securely and effectively.
